Asteroids Final
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the Spring of 2022, I attended a game design course where I learned C#. 
Throughout my coursework, I slowly iterated on a game, which was eventually submitted as my final.
My professor gave instructions for a specific type of game, but the creation and implementation of the majority of the code is my own.
The game implements player controls, screen wrapping, and attacking mechanics to recieve and deliver damage to enemies.
